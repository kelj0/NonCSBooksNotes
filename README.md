### Deep Work (Cal Newport)
Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

```
Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration 
	       that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new 
           value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while 
              distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the 
			  world and are easy to replicate

Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your 
capacity to perform deep work.

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time 
it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate 
this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well 
and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and 
those with access to capital.

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

Deliberate practice requires:
(1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to 
    improve or an idea you’re trying to master
(2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your 
    attention exactly where it’s most productive


High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

By maximizing his intensity when you work, you maximizes the results you produce per unit of time spent working.

When you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a 
residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets 
especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, 
but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.


If you’re not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult 
to get your performanceto the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly 
necessary to thrive professionally.


If you are just getting into some work and a phone goes off in the background, it ruins what 
you are concentrating on, even though you are not aware at the time, the brain 
responds to distractions.
