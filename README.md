### Deep Work (Cal Newport)
Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

```
Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration 
	       that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new 
           value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while 
              distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the 
			  world and are easy to replicate

Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your 
capacity to perform deep work.

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time 
it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate 
this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well 
and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and 
those with access to capital.

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

Deliberate practice requires:
(1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to 
    improve or an idea you’re trying to master
(2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your 
    attention exactly where it’s most productive


High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

By maximizing your intensity when you work, you maximize the results you produce per unit of time 
spent working.

When you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a 
residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets 
especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, 
but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.


If you’re not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult 
to get your performanceto the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly 
necessary to thrive professionally.


If you are just getting into some work and a phone goes off in the background, it ruins what 
you are concentrating on, even though you are not aware at the time, the brain 
responds to distractions.



Rules:
-> Work deeply
    + either work concentrated and uninterupted or dont work
    + rest from deep work, giv your brain time to process stuff
    + before starting an deep work session ask yourself:
        -Where you'll work and how long?
        -How you'll work once you start
            >Will you use internet? 
            >How much pages will you write per hour?
        -How you'll support your work?
            >ensure you have water near you
            >have access to enough food
    + by leveragin a radical change to your normal enviroment coupeled perhaps with a significent 
      investment of efford 
      or money all dedicated towards supoprting a deep work task you increase the percieved 
      importance of the work
    + Be lazy: Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable 
      to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction 
      as disfiguring as rickets… it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done

-> Embrace Boredom
    + To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting 
      stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient 
      that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention
    + Meditate productively
        - The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but 
          not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single 
          well-defined professional problem

-> Quit Social Media
    + You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, 
      or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.
    + Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal 
      life then adopt a tool only if positive impacts on these substantially outweight its negative 
      impacts
    + Ask yourself:
        - 1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?
        - 2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?
            > If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently. If your answer 
              was a clear “yes,” then return to using the service. If your answers are qualified or 
              ambiguous,it’s up to you whether you return to the service

-> Drain the Shallows
    + Firstly understand that Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your 
      abilities
    + "For someone new to such practice (citing, in particular, a child in the early stages 
       of developing an expert-level skill), an hour a day is a reasonable limit"
    + Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday
        - Advantage of scheduling your day is that you can determine how much time you’re 
          actually spending in shallow activities
    + Become hard to reach
        - Make people who send you email do more work
